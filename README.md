- Display the stock data using visualizations (e.g., line charts) and provide user interactivity (e.g., date range selection).

### 2. DNA

Creating a web app for DNA-related information could involve tasks like DNA sequence analysis, genome visualization, or educational content. Depending on the specific functionality you want, you might need various libraries or APIs related to bioinformatics and genomics.

- Set up a Streamlit app.
- Integrate relevant APIs or libraries for DNA analysis or visualization.
- Provide user-friendly interfaces for input (e.g., DNA sequence) and display results or visualizations.

### 3. NBA

For an NBA-related web app, you can include features like displaying live scores, player statistics, team information, and news updates. Here's a general approach:

- Set up a Streamlit app.
- Use sports-related APIs like the NBA API to fetch live scores, player stats, and other relevant data.
- Display this data in a user-friendly manner, possibly with interactive elements like dropdowns or filters.

### 4. NFL

A web app for NFL enthusiasts might include features like live game scores, team information, player statistics, and news updates:

- Set up a Streamlit app.
- Utilize sports-related APIs like the NFL API to fetch data such as scores, schedules, player stats, and more.
- Create visually appealing displays of this data using Streamlit's built-in charting capabilities and widgets.

## Seamless movement using Streamlit

The provided link, "https://python-multiapp.streamlit.app/," likely demonstrates how we can organize these different applications within a single Streamlit web app, allowing users to switch between them seamlessly. We can achieve this by using Streamlit's multi-page app structure or creating individual Streamlit scripts for each application and then using a Streamlit component like `st.components.iframe` to embed them into a single interface.

Remember to handle API authentication, data fetching, and visualization appropriately for each application to provide a smooth and engaging user experience. You can refer to the official Streamlit documentation (https://streamlit.io/docs/) for more details on building Streamlit web applications.
